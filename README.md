# Verifying-Neural-Network-using-Z3
In this project, I implemented a Neural Network using PyTorch and specified the properties of it in the language understandable by Z3. The project focuses on constraint-based verification, handling non-linear activation functions, translating the neural network model into Z3, and verifying the properties using Z3.
